# Buddhist Calendar DateTime and DateFormatter for Dart and Flutter

[ภาษาไทยอ่านวิธีใช้ที่นี่นะครับ]()

These are extension that you can get `DateTime` and `DateFormat` in Buddhist calendar's format. 

I implemented these extensions for use in Thai language project. **But you can contribute to add more support** for other countries who also use Buddhist calendar in the apps.
